# Earning the CompTIA Security+ at 16
> This article is over a year old, and as such, the information may not be accurate to the current state of things
## Introduction
The CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) CE as described on their [website](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) is "A global certification that validates the baseline skills necessary to perform core security functions and pursue an IT security career."

I first learned of the certification early 2021. I had previously been a bit active in the Cybersecurity community, scoring a few boxes on hackthebox and being active online on an older Twitter account. But, none of that really translated into the material asked for on the exam, so that meant one thing. **Study Time.**


## My Journey
Even though I had a few years of self-gained experience, I wanted to make the most out of this exam. I knew that it was going to be costly, and in the end, I wanted my money and time out of it. 

I used two resources:

[Professor Messer's Free Videos, Notes, and Practice Exams](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/)
This was a particularly great resource due to the ability to change the video speed, and the simplistic yet thorough notes provided. 

[TIA Educations Lab Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia_security_sy0-601_certification_training_class/)
I personally loved this one, Andrew was a great instructor, and above all, an entertaining person to watch. The hands on learning this course provided proved instrumental to the PBQ's on the exam. 

Deciding to start studying in August 2021, I was certain I wanted to complete it before my 17th birthday, and decided on the exam date of October 7, 2021.

I started studying immediately. I wasted no time in creating labs, testing and exploring certain security frameworks and applications. Likewise, I spent my free-time at school and on the weekends reviewing flashcard on Quizlet and playing the meteor game!

I felt ready around the 20th of September, and booked my exam then. 



## Cost
While confident in my abilities to pass the test, I didn't want to take the risk of having to purchase another voucher, so I went with the Basic Bundle.

This included: 
- CompTIA Security+ Exam Voucher
- CompTIA Security+ Exam Retake
- eBook – The Official CompTIA Security+ Study Guide (SY0-601)

This was $549.00

My Learning materials (Notes, Practice Exams, Labs), added up to around ~$52.  

I was fortunate enough to have my mother help cover some of the cost, and I would like to thank her for all the support she has given me on my path so far. 

In total, the exam and the learning materials cost **$601**.

## Tips
Here are some things that worked for me, keep in mind that just because they worked for me **does not mean they will work for you**.

1. Take practice exams, they do help.
2. Get hands on, you do not truly learn unless you can apply your knowledge.
3. READ THE QUESTION TWICE, I cannot tell you how many oddly worded questions might have slipped by if I had not triple checked my answers. 
4. Save the PBQ's till the end, they are not worth the time at the beginning. 
5. Don’t change your answers (unless you’re absolutely sure that the first answer you picked was incorrect)
6. Get enough sleep, you will not regret feeling well-rested before the exam.  



## Conclusion
This journey was a fun one, I played a lot, stressed a lot, but most importantly learned a lot. I know this information will prove vital for my future in INFOSEC, and I'm glad to have done it, and I am thankful for my family supporting me throughout all of this. 

Now, it's time for the OSCP.
