Hello there! My name is Jax(anger)! 

I am an 18-year-old security engineer currently based in the United States, studying Cyber Security engineering at George Mason University! I've always loved hacking, having competed in Capture-The-Flag(CTF) events for over two years! If I'm not doing CTFs with my university team, MasonCC, I can be found reading (I love sci-fi), skateboarding, or rock climbing.

I currently specialize in web application exploition, and I'm currently learning more about browser sandbox escaping.
